                <p>Initially inspired by the view out of my window of the intertwining winter tree branches, I wanted to delve into the computability of biological structures whilst questioning our distance to technology and what we consider as beautiful or complex. I was always drawn to natureâ€™s unpredictable, elegant textures and repelled by anything synthetic, so it was surprising to find that it only took 63 degrees of angle rotation to transition between an elegant wild plant to a hard-line digital grid, which made me question my own perception. This led to further exploration, the result of which portrays the process from natural to digital in three steps using the same plant-system in each image.</p>
